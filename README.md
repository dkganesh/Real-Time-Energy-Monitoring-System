REAL TIME ENERGY MONITORING SYSTEM INCORPORATED WITH AUTOMATED FUNCTIONS
An energy meter is an electrical device that measures the electrical energy being consumed over time, but now, in modern world this out dated to execute, there comes the IoT(Internet of Things) enabled Energy meter , that monitor units consumed and transmit the cost and units through Wi-Fi, Since time goes on and technology grows we, our team have tried to incorporate the essence of Automation into the existing tech IoT, we hope will upgrade the normal smart energy meter to a super smart one. To be clear, our end result will supervise the monitored units and cost by smart meter by an added circuit driven by custom firmware which will cut-off the non-essential loads running, and minimize the energy usage, will also keep the daily energy cost under the culmination value set by the user, also the user will have the full control over the system through a mobile app powered by IoT.
